👋 Hi, I'm Logichh {Milin}

I'm a full stack developer with a strong focus on Minecraft plugin development and custom resource pack creation. I build for the web and for the block.

## 🚀 What I Do

- **Full Stack Web Development**  
  Building responsive apps using [React/Vue/etc.], Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and more.

- **Minecraft Plugin Development**  
  Creating custom plugins for Spigot/Paper using Java (Java 21 ready), with support for custom items, GUIs, and server mechanics.

- **Resource Pack Design**  
  Custom textures, UI, and models for Minecraft (OptiFine-compatible and vanilla).

- **Tooling & Automation**  
  Writing tools/scripts to speed up dev workflows. GitHub Actions, CLI utilities, and other backend helpers.
